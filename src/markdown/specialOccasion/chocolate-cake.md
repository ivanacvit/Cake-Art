####THINGS YOU'LL NEED
*Ingredients*

####LET'S GET STARTED!
1. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment.

3. Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.
4. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
5. For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave, stirring every 30 secs. Leave the melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.

####TIME TO DECORATE!
1. To make chocolate shards: melt 50g dark chocolate and pour it onto a tray lined with baking parchment or foil.
2. Now melt 25g milk chocolate and 25g white chocolate and drizzle them over the dark chocolate before it sets.
3. Shake the tray gently to level the mixture then leave to set somewhere cool. Chop into shards.
